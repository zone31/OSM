\section*{Task 1}
On the MIPS architecture, the TLB is handled in software. This means that the CPU calls interrupts, when a virtual memory address is tried to be accessed, while it is not in memory. When the interrupts are called, it is the operating systems responsibility to handle and solve them.
Our implementation has some issues, but the idea is as follows, and can be
viewed in \textit{vm/tlb.c}:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Get the state of the exception with a call to
        \texttt{\_tlb_get\_exception\_state} which is a function implemented in
        assembly code.  The call returns a structure containing a badvpn2, the
        virtual page number failing, a badvaddr the address failing and an asid
        the id of the thread failing.
    \item Iterate through the page table, to find the Virtual Page Number (VPN)
        the instruction used.  Found in step one.
    \item Check if the valid bit is set for the found page, if so, continue,
        otherwise report an error either by a kernel panic or by closing the
        thread and giving the user an equivalent error to a segmentation fault.
    \item We now try and find empty spot in the TLB, we do this with the
        assembly implemented function \texttt{\_tlb\_probe}, the function
        returns a negative value if no space is free in the TLB and an index in
        the TLB array otherwise.
    \item If the return value of \texttt{\_tlb\_probe} is positive we write to
        the given entry in the TLB by calling \texttt{\_tlb\_write}, which is
        also implemented in assembly.  Otherwise we use
        \texttt{\_tlb\_write\_random} to write the entry to a random location in
        the TLB.
    \item If the write to the TLB was successful the function returns not
        without executing the final step.
    \item Lastly we check if a userland or a kernel thread is running.  If a
        userland thread is running we removes the pagetable for that thread and
        close the thread reporting a segmentation fault like error to the user.
        If the thread is a kernel thread a \texttt{KERNEL PANIC} is created.
\end{enumerate}

Our implementation fails, because it looks for an address that is off by a few bytes. A small test showed, that the difference between the correct address and address asked for is: (size of allocation)/2048 rounded up to nearest integer. A guess to why this error occurs, is because the VPN is exactly 2048 bytes and it might be allocated twice by mistake.

\section*{Task 2}
    We haven't made a working task 2, we used all the time we had trying to get
    task 1 to work so their wasn't any time for task 2.  We will here try to
    explain what task two should have done had it been implemented. \\

    In task two we were asked to create a function to help the implementation of
    malloc to allocate space on the heap.  The function to implement is called
    \texttt{syscall\_memlimit} and has the prototype,

    \begin{lstlisting}[style=customc]
void * syscall_memlimit(void *new_end);
    \end{lstlisting}

    The function should allocate more space for userland processes when they
    need it.  The function should try to move a heap pointer to the new point
    \texttt{heap\_end}, if this is possible the function should return a pointer
    to the new space allocated, if not the function should return \texttt{NULL}.
    If the function is given NULL as a parameter it should return the current
    end of the heap.  Normally a user process can both allocate and free memory
    from the heap, in Buenos freeing space on the heap is not implemented and
    therefore the heap can always only grow and never shrink.  This means that
    if a user attempts to decrease the heapsize the function should return an
    error, either a \texttt{NULL} pointer or a \texttt{KERNEL PANIC}.  \\

    The userland library \texttt{tests/lib.c} already contains an implementation
    of \texttt{malloc}, although this \texttt{malloc} implementation can only
    allocate 256 bytes.  If we had implemented \texttt{syscall\_memlimit} we
    could use this function in malloc when malloc runs out of memory to obtain
    more space from the system that can be used by the user.
